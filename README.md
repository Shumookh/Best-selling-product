# Best-selling-product
Have you ever felt anxious about not selling your products? Imagine you own a small store, and every month comes with questions: "What will be the best-selling product for the next month?" This has become a possible reality with the use of a technology called "neural networks." With past sales data, such as product types, months, and holidays, you won't feel anxious anymore; instead, you'll have time to improve your store and serve your customers better.
Remember: Smart solutions can turn challenges into successes.
